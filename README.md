# Welcome

Test automation is huge, it is done for different layers/stacks of the application. While everyone
learns based on their unique context and environments, we could all use a bit of initial guidance
and help when first breaking into a specific focus area within the field.

## Our Goal

This repository hopes/aims to be a community driven reference guide towards that goal with curated
list of resources on how to learn test automation effectively.

The main problem we are trying to solve is:

> What are some of the blog posts, newsletters, YouTube videos, courses, podcasts that are
> insightful, stand out and taught you a unique concept within Test automation?

Let's put that here and file it under the appropriate category, so that the entire community has a
reference to that.
