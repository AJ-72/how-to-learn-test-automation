## How to give useful feedback

- [Kim Scott - How to give useful feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUJHgryZ1Hs)
- Think of feedback more as **guidance**
- We want, Good stuff people do => Do more of it => Give praise
- We want, Bad stuff people do => Stop doing it => Give criticism
- Give guidance with a spirit of being Humble, helpful
  - You are trying to help the person solve/fix a problem
  - You want to give guidance immediately and in-person
  - Remember: Feedback is measured **not at your mouth** but at the **other persons ear**
    - You need to see how the other person is reacting to the feedback
    - > You want to give praise in public and criticism in private
      - Praise is specific and sincere
      - Criticism is Kind and clear
    - Give praise/criticism about a persons behavior, You don't want to make it about their
      personality
    - Give a little criticism and lot of praise every single week

    - You are just being a jerk
  - **Ruinous empathy** - Care personally + Don't challenge directly
    - Trying to be nice, but not help people improve
  - **Manipulative insincerity** - Don't care personally + Don't challenge directly
