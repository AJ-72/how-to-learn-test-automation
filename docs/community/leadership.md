## [Amy Cuddy - Be the best boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R49CMHpM6s)

- To be an effective leader
  - Likeability, Trustworthiness trumps Strength, confidence, Decisiveness
  - Let your team know, why they should trust you?
  - You don't get trust by default, you earn trust?

## [Susan Cain - How to lead introverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbhctpQVyJk)

- You won't be able to lead introverts if you don't under who they are, what their needs are?
- There is no one size fits all strategy
- Figure out the team, where each member complements each other and then you are going to be greater
  than the sum of your parts

## How to give useful feedback

- [Kim Scott - How to give useful feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUJHgryZ1Hs)
- Think of feedback more as **guidance**
- Good stuff people do => Do more of it => Praise
- Bad stuff people do => Stop doing it => Criticism
- Give guidance with a spirit of being Humble, helpful
  - Trying to help the person solve/fix a problem
  - You want to give guidance immediately and in-person
  - Feedback is measured **not at your mouth** but at the **other persons ear**
    - You need to see how the other person is reacting to the feedback
    - > You want to give praise in public and criticism in private
      - Praise is specific and sincere
      - Criticism is Kind and clear
    - Give praise/criticism about a persons behavior, You don't want to make it about their
      personality
    - Give a little criticism and lot of praise every single week

## [Kim Scott - Care personally. Challenge directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWaJ2pkDiWU)

- Radical candor - Care personally + Challenge directly
  - Correct style âœ…, Impromptu feedback delivered in person with compassion
  - Just say what you think
- Obnoxious aggression - Challenge directly + Don't show that you care
  - You are just being a jerk
- Ruinous empathy - Care personally + Don't challenge directly
  - Trying to be nice, but not help people improve
- Manipulative insincerity - Don't care personally + Don't challenge directly
  - Political, passive aggressive, backstabbing behavior
- Don't judge someone, but try to move to radical candor
