# Welcome

Test automation is huge, it is done for different layers/stacks of the application. While everyone
learns based on their unique context and environments, we could all use a bit of initial guidance
and help when first breaking into a specific focus area within the field.

## Our Goal

This repository hopes/aims to be a community driven reference guide for that goal with curated list
of resources

> What are some of the blog posts, Newsletters, YouTube videos, Courses, Podcasts that are
> insightful, stand out and taught you a unique concept within Test automation? Let's put that here
> and file it under the required category.
